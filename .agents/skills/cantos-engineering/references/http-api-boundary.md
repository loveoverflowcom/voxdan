# HTTP API boundary

> **Scope.** Keep Cantos Axum handlers thin and its contracts explicit: raw request DTOs,
> backend-enforced authorization, typed error mapping, idempotent retriable writes, versioned
> OpenAPI/JSON Schema, and generated clients for Leptos and CMP. Use when adding or changing an
> endpoint, DTO, error code, pagination, authentication rule or client contract.

Listener-facing contracts are owned by [`cantos-listening`](../../cantos-listening/references/listener-api.md);
this reference owns the general shape every endpoint follows. No endpoint exists yet; the first
slice establishes the contract tooling ([contracts README](../../../../contracts/README.md)).

## A handler is a shell

```text
extract + authenticate          Axum extractors, session → Actor
decode raw DTO                  serde, syntax only
convert to domain input         TryFrom, field-level diagnostics
authorize                       pure: (actor, resource, action) → Permit | Denied
decide                          pure core
persist / enqueue               adapter, one transaction, outbox
map outcome → response          typed error → status + stable code
```

```rust
// Illustrative.
async fn save_draft(
    State(app): State<AppState>,
    actor: Actor,
    Path(script_id): Path<ScriptId>,
    Json(request): Json<SaveDraftRequest>,
) -> Result<Json<DraftSaved>, ApiError> {
    let edit = DraftEdit::try_from(request)?;
    let draft = app.scripts.load_draft(script_id).await?;
    let permit = authorize(&actor, &draft, Action::EditScript)?;
    let saved = app.scripts.save_draft(permit, draft.apply(edit)?).await?;
    Ok(Json(DraftSaved::from(saved)))
}
```

The handler holds no business rule, builds no SQL and inspects no provider payload.

## Authorization lives in the backend

Every endpoint decides `(actor, resource, action)` on the server, fail-closed. A hidden or
disabled button is presentation, never protection. Studio roles (edit, produce, accept QC,
approve publication) and listener access are distinct actions even when one creator holds all of
them ([business rules § Rights and access](../../../../docs/product/business-rules.md#rights-and-access)).
Test each action with an allowed actor, a denied actor and an actor from another tenant or
account.

## Errors

- Domain errors are enums. The adapter maps each variant to an HTTP status and a stable,
  documented error code; the message is safe for display after localization on the client.
- Never return raw SQL, provider or stack-trace text. Never put secrets, signed URLs or private
  manuscript text in error bodies or logs.
- Validation errors at a creator-facing endpoint list every independent field problem.
- Conflicts (stale revision, lost lease, duplicate operation) are distinct codes with the current
  server revision when the client needs it to reconcile.

## Retriable writes

Clients send a stable operation ID (idempotency key) on any write they may retry. The server
records it in the same transaction as the effect, returns the original result for a duplicate,
and rejects reuse of the key with different content. Test duplicate delivery explicitly.

## Contracts

- One source of truth per contract (OpenAPI or JSON Schema), versioned, with serialized fixtures
  in `contracts/`. Record how the Rust types (consumed by the server and the Leptos client) and
  the Kotlin types are generated or validated; generated files name their source and generation
  command.
- Identifiers are opaque stable IDs, never titles or storage paths.
- Pagination, ordering, server timestamps and revisions are explicit fields.
- Compatibility: additive changes are safe only when consumers ignore unknown fields
  deliberately; removing or retyping a field is a version change with a migration window.
- A contract test asserts the handler's real response against the schema and fixtures, and a
  client test decodes the same fixtures. A round trip through new code alone proves nothing about
  old clients.

## Evidence

| Claim | Evidence |
|---|---|
| authorization decision | `example-tested` table over actors × actions on the pure authorizer |
| handler wiring and status mapping | handler test with a fake application state (`example-tested` against a double) |
| constraint, transaction or idempotency behavior | `integration-tested` against PostgreSQL |
| schema conformance | contract test over fixtures for each supported version |
| a client decodes the response | the client's own fixture test on its platform |
