# Local execution, tooling reality and remote compute

> **Scope.** Decide what an agent may run while working on Cantos and how to report it:
> discovering real commands, focused local checks first, resource limits, paid providers,
> remote CI, secrets and generated media. Use before running any build, test, provider call,
> browser or device session, and before pushing or opening a pull request.

## Discover, never assume

Cantos is a documentation bootstrap. Before citing or running a command, establish separately:

| Fact | Adequate source |
|---|---|
| the toolchain is configured | a manifest (`Cargo.toml`, `build.gradle.kts`, `package.json`) or script in the repository |
| a test or target exists | its source, discovered by the actual runner |
| the executable is available here | a successful `--version` in this environment |
| a result was obtained | attributable output from a run in this session |
| CI runs it | the workflow file and the command it invokes |
| it is a required merge gate | repository rules — workflow YAML alone is not enough |

None implies another. A command written in a skill, a work-plan item or an issue is a proposal
until the repository implements it. Mark unknown capability as unknown.

Current checks (run from the repository root):

```sh
python3 scripts/check_repository.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_*.py'
git diff --check
```

They validate documents, links, JSON syntax, text hygiene and skill structure. They do not build,
test or run any application.

## Focused first, proportionate after

1. Run the single test or check that settles the claim.
2. Then the module or package suite.
3. Then the broader gates the change warrants, sequentially on a constrained machine.

Docs-only or read-only work must not start a heavy build merely to "have a baseline". Report any
required gate that remains unrun on the residual-risk line.

## Resources

Before an expensive build, browser or emulator run: check free disk on the filesystems that will
receive artifacts, memory pressure and concurrent work. Run one heavy lane at a time (Cargo,
Gradle, Xcode, browser). Do not kill unrelated processes, delete caches you do not own, or install
SDKs, emulators or toolchains outside the task's scope to get a green result. A resource limit
never authorizes weaker checks or remote compute.

## Paid providers and external services

- Never call a commercial TTS or adaptation provider without an explicit user request, a
  configured cost limit and server-side credentials supplied by the user's secret store.
- Use fake or local providers for tests; label them as such in every report.
- A provider-live run records provider, model, request IDs, measured usage and cost, and the
  sample's rights status.
- Never trigger production publication, CDN purges or storage deletion from an agent task.

## Remote CI and publishing

The repository workflow runs document checks on pushes and pull requests to `develop`. Pushing a
branch or opening a PR consumes CI and is outward-facing: do it only when the user asks. Never
debug by repeatedly re-running remote jobs, never relax branch protection, and never treat a
remote green check as a substitute for the local evidence a claim needs.

## Secrets, private content and media

- Never commit secrets, provider credentials, signed URLs, private manuscripts, downloaded media
  or generated audio. `.gitignore` already excludes common audio formats, `/artifacts/` and
  `/private-assets/`; keep generated evidence there or under `target/`.
- Do not print environment variables or credential files to logs or reports.
- Redact before an image, log or transcript reaches any external tool.

## Reporting execution

For every check, record: exact command, working directory, source revision plus dirty state,
toolchain version, result (`passed | failed | blocked | not-run | unavailable | zero-selected`)
and where its output lives. `blocked`, `not-run`, `unavailable` and `zero-selected` are never
reported as passing.
