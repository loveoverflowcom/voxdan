  Web renderer execution for Cantos Studio and Cantos Theatre Web in Leptos: separate surface and
  permission contexts, component → resource/action → port → HTTP adapter layering, explicit async
  states with stale-response guards, DOM and HTMLMediaElement playback interop, the text-first

  token-driven CSS/SCSS carrying Material 3 Expressive intent, and scoped browser evidence. Use
  when building, changing or testing Leptos components, routes, signals, resources, actions,
  web-sys code, the Studio script editor, casting or production-progress screens, the Theatre Web
  player or mini-player, or Web stylesheets.

# Cantos Leptos Web

This skill is the **Web renderer's behavioral contract and router** for Cantos Studio and Cantos
Theatre Web. It composes two owners and redefines neither:

- [`cantos-engineering`](../cantos-engineering/SKILL.md) — the required order, the
  [evidence vocabulary](../cantos-engineering/SKILL.md#6-never-collapse-evidence-into-the-word-verified)
  and the [completion report](../cantos-engineering/SKILL.md#9-completion-report).
- [`cantos-ui-design`](../cantos-ui-design/SKILL.md) — the
  [shared UI loop](../cantos-ui-design/SKILL.md#shared-ui-loop), Material 3 Expressive intent,
  tokens, localization, accessibility, motion, component states, visual review and the
  [UI completion report](../cantos-ui-design/SKILL.md#completion-report).

Load this file, then only the references the change touches, one at a time.

## When to use

Use for Leptos components, routes, signals, resources, actions, `view!` markup, `web-sys` or
`wasm-bindgen` code, CSS/SCSS, Web component or browser tests, and for these Web surfaces:
Studio import and adaptation review, the script editor, casting, production progress and partial
regeneration ([#8](../../../docs/work-plan/project-planning.md#ordered-implementation-issues)), QC
and publication controls, and Theatre discovery, episode pages, the mini-player and full player.

| The task is instead about… | Use |
|---|---|
| visual intent, token values, type scale, motion intent, copy, accessibility targets | [`cantos-ui-design`](../cantos-ui-design/SKILL.md) (this skill applies its output) |
| Script IR shape, IDs, revisions, validator errors, import/adaptation output | [`cantos-script-ir`](../cantos-script-ir/SKILL.md) |
| what regenerates, job states, costs, budgets, QC records | [`cantos-production-pipeline`](../cantos-production-pipeline/SKILL.md) |
| rights, approvals, publish gates, manifests, signed delivery | [`cantos-publication`](../cantos-publication/SKILL.md) |
| playback state meaning, progress and bookmark sync, listener API | [`cantos-listening`](../cantos-listening/SKILL.md) |
| Android/iOS Theatre in Compose Multiplatform | [`cantos-cmp-mobile`](../cantos-cmp-mobile/SKILL.md) |
| a report-only UI/UX audit | [`cantos-ui-inspector`](../cantos-ui-inspector/SKILL.md) |
| reviewing an existing diff | [`cantos-code-review`](../cantos-code-review/SKILL.md) |

A Web screen that changes domain state composes the owner for that state: this skill decides how
the browser renders and drives it, the owner decides what is true.

## Ground rules

- **Repository reality.** No Leptos package, toolchain config, dev server or Web test harness
  exists. Discover manifests, scripts and CI before citing a command. Commands, crates, paths and
  types in this skill and its references are **proposed** or **candidates** until the repository
  implements them; a library becomes a dependency only through a recorded decision
  ([`templates/adr.md`](../../../templates/adr.md)) and a pinned, verified version.
- **Product requirements are owned by docs.** [`apps/web/README.md`](../../../apps/web/README.md),
  the [UI system](../../../docs/design/ui-system.md), and the work items
  [010 (editor)](../../../docs/work-plan/010-import-and-edit-script.md),
  [020 (casting, progress)](../../../docs/work-plan/020-cast-and-generate-dialogue.md),
  [030 (QC, publication)](../../../docs/work-plan/030-mix-review-and-publish.md) and
  [040 (Theatre Web)](../../../docs/work-plan/040-theatre-web-listening.md). Link them; never
  restate a competing copy of a rule.
- **Distinguish proposed, implemented and verified** in code comments, docs and reports.

## Web non-negotiables

| Rule | Failure it prevents | Oracle | Depth |
|---|---|---|---|
| Studio and Theatre are separate surfaces and permission contexts with their own route roots, contexts and ports | a listener route reaches a private draft, preview or Studio port | Theatre routes mount with only `TheatreContext`; backend authorization tests | [`web-architecture.md`](references/web-architecture.md#1-two-surfaces-two-permission-contexts) |
| Components render and dispatch; ports come from context; adapters own URLs, DTOs and error classification | transport and provider details leak into markup and cannot be tested without a network | component test runs on an in-memory port | [`web-architecture.md`](references/web-architecture.md#2-layering-inside-a-surface) |
| Durable rules live in pure core crates; the browser renders server gates (approval, publish, budget, regeneration scope) and never decides them | drifted copies of gates; UI-only permission checks | review; same validator crate on both sides | [`web-architecture.md`](references/web-architecture.md#3-which-decisions-the-browser-may-make) |
| No credential, private object access or signed URL in client code, build-time config, routes, storage or logs | secrets shipped in the bundle; private media made shareable | review; proposed bundle grep | [`web-architecture.md`](references/web-architecture.md#5-secrets-and-private-media-never-reach-browser-code) |
| Every remote state is explicit, failure is never empty, a stale response never wins, every mutation states its duplicate-submit behavior | "No episodes" on a 500; an old response replacing a new one; double-billed generation | out-of-order component test; per-state tests | [`leptos-async.md`](references/leptos-async.md) |
| A failed or conflicting request never costs the creator text; conflicts are never last write wins | lost dialogue after a timeout; silent overwrite of a competing edit | failing and conflicting fake ports | [`script-editor.md`](references/script-editor.md#4-draft-save-and-version-states) |
| Playback state comes from media events through the shared reducer; one shell-owned `<audio>` survives navigation | a "playing" button over blocked audio; playback stopping on route change | real-browser playback and navigation test | [`dom-and-media-interop.md`](references/dom-and-media-interop.md#6-theatre-playback-through-htmlmediaelement) |
| The editor keys rows by dialogue ID and never commits, reformats or rewrites text during IME composition | Telex/VNI input corrupted; edits attached to the wrong line | insert-above focus test; composition regression; recorded IME walkthrough | [`script-editor.md`](references/script-editor.md) |
| Styles consume token roles; classes are semantic; state styles hang off semantic attributes; themes, reduced motion and focus are always handled | literal colors and radii; utility walls; invisible focus | manual review now, proposed style gate later; inspected captures | [`styling.md`](references/styling.md) |
| Evidence is named exactly: `DOM-tested` ≠ `interaction-tested` ≠ `integration-tested`; `compiled` and `screenshot-captured` are not inspection | overclaiming from fakes, synthetic events or unopened images | report review against the vocabulary | [`web-testing.md`](references/web-testing.md) |

How the foundation lands in the browser:

- **Decoupling.** Web depends on pure core crates and generated contract types, never on backend
  application or infrastructure crates, provider SDKs or Narrative Forge types.
- **Immutability.** Reducers take state by value and return new state; a save snapshot is an
  immutable value; accepted revisions, approvals and release manifests arrive read-only and are
  never patched client-side.
- **Functional core.** Editor, playback, retry, poll-schedule and merge decisions are pure and
  tested with plain `#[test]`; Leptos and `web-sys` are the shell.
- **Types as proofs.** `Retryability::UnkeyedWrite` cannot be retried; `SpeakerRef::Unresolved` is
  a state, not an empty string; exhaustive matches map every validator and port error.
- **Clean syntax.** Readable `view!` with semantic classes, small named helpers, no `unwrap()` on
  browser globals, formatter-clean Rust and stylesheets.
- **Material 3 Expressive.** Applied through tokens at each surface's intensity: a quiet,
  rectangular reading area in the editor; more expressive shape and motion in Theatre discovery and
  the player ([`material3-expressive.md`](../cantos-ui-design/references/material3-expressive.md)).

## The Web development loop

Run the [shared UI loop](../cantos-ui-design/SKILL.md#shared-ui-loop); at each of its steps, apply
these Web specifics:

```text
0  discover   apps/web manifests, toolchain config, scripts, CI. If none exist, the work item
              establishes them through a reviewed decision; never hand-roll a server or runner
1  scope      surface + permission context, route, ports, the owning doc's acceptance line,
              the claim and its failure mode
2  core       a durable decision? → its owner's pure crate with plain #[test] first
3  boundary   port provided through context; HTTP adapter over generated contract types;
              typed PortError
4  async      resource/action states, request key, duplicate-submit policy, retry decision
5  view       semantic HTML, NodeRef, cleanup, locale keys, token classes, attribute-driven state
6  evidence   cheapest regression first: core → component with TestWorld → real-browser input
7  look       documented app command → scenario → open captures → findings → fix → SAME scenario
8  tidy       formatter and linter of every touched toolchain, in check mode
9  report     shared UI report + the Web additions below; residual risk never empty
```

Step 8 candidates, to confirm against the real manifests: `cargo fmt --check`, Clippy for the
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` target with warnings denied, a `view!` formatter such as `leptosfmt`, and
the stylesheet formatter the package adopts. Skipping a step is a decision you state.

| The change needs… | Put it in | Never in |
|---|---|---|
| a validation, merge, reconciliation, retry or schedule decision | the owner's pure core crate | a component, resource or effect |
| a network call | a port and its HTTP adapter | a component |
| state that must survive navigation (playback session, editor draft) | the surface shell or the route root | a route leaf or a pane |
| a browser API | a `platform/` helper with a typed error | a component body |
| a color, radius, spacing or motion value | a token role ([`tokens.md`](../cantos-ui-design/references/tokens.md)) | a component literal |
| visible or accessible text | locale resources ([`localization.md`](../cantos-ui-design/references/localization.md)) | a `view!` literal |
| an authorization or gate decision | the backend | anywhere in WASM |

Before handing off, check states with [`component-states.md`](../cantos-ui-design/references/component-states.md),
semantics and focus with [`accessibility.md`](../cantos-ui-design/references/accessibility.md),
motion with [`motion.md`](../cantos-ui-design/references/motion.md), and captures with
[`visual-review.md`](../cantos-ui-design/references/visual-review.md).

## Web report additions

Extend the [UI completion report](../cantos-ui-design/SKILL.md#completion-report), which already
extends the [foundation report](../cantos-engineering/SKILL.md#9-completion-report), with:

```text
Surface / permission context:  Studio | Theatre; routes; ports and adapters touched
Rendering mode / build:        CSR | SSR per ADR; exact build and serve command; debug | release
Browsers / engines:            engine and version per result; headless | headed; flags used
Backend for evidence:          fake ports | named local services | shared environment
Async races covered:           stale response, duplicate submit, unmount, retry exhaustion
Input methods:                 keyboard, pointer, touch emulation, IME (CDP-simulated | named OS IME)
Media path:                    none | generated local file | real storage/CDN; range requests seen
Style review:                  manual token, focus and motion review scope (no gate implemented)
```

A skill-only or docs-only edit needs no app run; say that no Web behavior was exercised.

Foundation: [`cantos-engineering`](../cantos-engineering/SKILL.md). Shared UI policy:
[`cantos-ui-design`](../cantos-ui-design/SKILL.md). Domain owners:
[`cantos-script-ir`](../cantos-script-ir/SKILL.md) for editor content and validation,
[`cantos-production-pipeline`](../cantos-production-pipeline/SKILL.md) for casting, generation and
progress, [`cantos-publication`](../cantos-publication/SKILL.md) for QC, approval and publish
controls, and [`cantos-listening`](../cantos-listening/SKILL.md) for

[progress sync](../cantos-listening/references/progress-sync.md). Scenarios for the visual loop:
[`cantos-ui-inspector`](../cantos-ui-inspector/references/scenarios.md). Native listening shares
vocabulary and state meaning with [`cantos-cmp-mobile`](../cantos-cmp-mobile/SKILL.md), never
runtime code. Task entrypoints [`cantos-work-item`](../cantos-work-item/SKILL.md) and
[`cantos-code-review`](../cantos-code-review/SKILL.md) load this skill for Web changes.
