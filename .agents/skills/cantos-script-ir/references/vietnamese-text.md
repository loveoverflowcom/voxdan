# Vietnamese text in Script IR

> **Scope.** Unicode policy for script text: NFC normalization at every entry path, byte versus
> code point versus UTF-16 versus grapheme offsets, equality versus search versus sort, the
> whitespace and invisible-character policy, pronunciation overrides as typed data and
> Vietnamese test vectors. Use when code stores, compares, digests, slices, searches, measures or
> anchors anything to dialogue, character or title text, or when fixtures contain Vietnamese.

Product context: the [Script IR dialogue model](../../../../docs/architecture/script-ir.md#purpose)
(spoken text and optional pronunciation overrides),
[business rule 9](../../../../docs/product/business-rules.md#casting-and-performance)
(pronunciation rules stay inspectable) and the
[010 risks](../../../../docs/work-plan/010-import-and-edit-script.md#risks--unknowns) (confirm
languages and pronunciation needs with real fixtures). Fonts, diacritic clipping and display
belong to [`cantos-ui-design`](../../cantos-ui-design/references/typography.md); editor input
and selection mapping to [`script-editor.md`](../../cantos-leptos-web/references/script-editor.md).
The policy below is proposed; record it with the first Script IR ADR.

## 1. Three facts that break naive code

1. **The same visible text has several byte sequences.** Precomposed (NFC), decomposed (NFD,
   produced by some input-method settings and older macOS file paths) and the mixed form that
   Windows-1258 decoding yields are all common. Unnormalized, each looks like a changed line, a
   new digest and a paid re-render.
2. **One visible letter is 1–3 code points and 1–3 UTF-8 bytes.** `ờ` is one code point (3 bytes)
   in NFC and three code points in NFD. Byte, code point, UTF-16 and grapheme counts all differ.
3. **Normalization does not unify everything.** Tone placement variants (`hòa` / `hoà`,
   `thúy` / `thuý`) are different strings in every normalization form, and `đ` (U+0111) has no
   decomposition, so "strip the diacritics" leaves it untouched.

## 2. Normalization policy

| Rule | Why | Good | Counterexample | Oracle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| derived text is NFC, enforced by the type (`SpokenText`, `DisplayText`) | one value, one byte sequence, one digest | `SpokenText::new` normalizes and validates | a `String` field normalized "usually" | NFD vectors through every entry path |
| every entry path constructs through that type | one forgotten path reopens false diffs | editor save, extraction, adaptation output, structured import, Narrative Forge adapter, fixture loader, row decoder | the fixture loader building structs directly | a test per entry path |
| stored revisions are validated, not re-normalized, on read | a stored non-NFC revision is corruption; silently fixing it changes its digest | `RevisionCorrupted { id }` | normalize-on-read | tampered-row test |
| preserved source bytes are never normalized | provenance must be byte-exact | checksum of the upload equals the stored object | normalizing the upload before hashing | checksum test |
| NFC, never NFKC | NFKC rewrites meaning: `…` becomes `...`, full-width and superscript forms change | NFC keeps `…` | NFKC "to be safe" | vector for `…` |
| tone placement is preserved | it is the author's orthography; rewriting is an edit | `hoà` stays `hoà` | a normalizer that moves tone marks | vector pair stays distinct |

Record the normalization library (a `unicode-normalization` crate is a candidate) and the
Unicode version it implements. Unicode's normalization stability policy keeps results stable for
assigned characters, but pin and test rather than assume.

Combining-mark order is handled by normalization: `a` + U+0302 + U+0323 and `a` + U+0323 +
U+0302 both normalize to `ậ` (U+1EAD), because canonical ordering sorts marks by combining class.
Never compare or hash before normalizing.

## 3. Test vectors

Use these in fixtures and tests; each NFC/NFD pair must produce identical `SpokenText` bytes,
identical `SpokenContent` bytes, an empty revision diff and the same content digest.

| Text | NFC code points / UTF-8 bytes | NFD code points / UTF-8 bytes |
|---|---|---|
| `Người` | 5 / 8 | 8 / 11 |
| `Người dẫn chuyện` | 16 / 23 | 23 / 30 |
| `Ánh đèn cuối sân khấu` | 21 / 29 | 28 / 36 |
| `Ngày mai, mình có diễn tiếp không?` | 34 / 42 | 42 / 50 |
| `Vọng Đài` | 8 / 12 | 10 / 13 (`Đ` does not decompose) |

```text
"Người"  NFC  U+004E U+0067 U+01B0 U+1EDD U+0069
         NFD  U+004E U+0067 U+0075 U+031B U+006F U+031B U+0300 U+0069
Windows-1258 bytes 4E 67 FD F5 CC 69 decode to
              U+004E U+0067 U+01B0 U+01A1 U+0300 U+0069   (neither NFC nor NFD; NFC → "Người")
```

Tone marks are U+0300 (huyền), U+0301 (sắc), U+0303 (ngã), U+0309 (hỏi) and U+0323 (nặng);
vowel modifiers are U+0302 (circumflex), U+0306 (breve) and U+031B (horn). A property generator
can build syllables from base vowels, these marks and consonants including `đ`, then emit each
character composed or decomposed at random.

Distinct-on-purpose pairs (must stay different): `hòa` / `hoà`, `thúy` / `thuý`, `Đ` (U+0110) /
`Ð` (U+00D0, a look-alike from another alphabet).

## 4. Offsets and lengths

| Unit | Native to | `Người` (NFC) | `Người` (NFD) |
|---|---|---|---|
| UTF-8 bytes | Rust `str`, most storage | 8 | 11 |
| code points | Rust `chars()`, PostgreSQL `length()` on UTF-8 text | 5 | 8 |
| UTF-16 code units | browser DOM and JavaScript, Kotlin/JVM `String` | 5 | 8 |
| extended grapheme clusters | what a reader calls a character | 5 | 5 |

- An offset that crosses a boundary carries its unit in its type and wire name
  (`Utf8ByteRange`, `GraphemeRange`, `"start_utf16"`). A bare `"start": 12` is ambiguous between
  Rust, the browser and Kotlin.
- Convert at the edge. The Leptos editor reports UTF-16 selections; the server stores its own
  unit; conversion lives in one tested function per pair of units.
- Prefer anchors that are not offsets at all (stable IDs, terms with an occurrence index), because
  any edit earlier in a line moves every offset after it.
- `&text[..n]` panics when `n` falls inside a multi-byte character such as `ờ`. Truncate previews
  on grapheme boundaries (a `unicode-segmentation` crate is a candidate).
- User-facing length limits count graphemes; storage and request limits count bytes. Provider
  request limits belong to the pipeline's adapter.

## 5. Equality, search and sort

| Purpose | Form | Example |
|---|---|---|
| equality, diff, digest, `SpokenContent` | NFC plus the whitespace policy, exact code points | `hòa` ≠ `hoà` |
| Studio search | folded: NFD, remove nonspacing marks, map `đ`/`Đ` → `d`, Unicode lowercase | `nguoi dan` finds `Người dẫn chuyện`; `vong dai` finds `Vọng Đài` |
| sorting names for display | Vietnamese collation (an ICU-based collator is a candidate) | `a ă â b c d đ e ê …`, not code point order |
| canonical order inside encodings | stable ID | never by name or folded text |

Folded text is an index, never content: it is not stored as dialogue text, digested or diffed.
Without the explicit `đ` mapping, folding `Vọng Đài` yields `vong đai` and search misses it.
Use Unicode lowercasing; `to_ascii_lowercase` leaves `Ấ` unchanged.

## 6. Whitespace and invisible characters

Proposed `SpokenText` policy. Import applies it with conversion notes; the editor applies it on
save.

| Input | Policy | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| leading and trailing whitespace | trim | invisible, changes bytes |
| runs of `White_Space`, including U+00A0 (common in DOCX), U+3000, tab, U+2028 | collapse to one U+0020 | one visible text, one encoding |
| line breaks inside a line | collapse to U+0020 | a dialogue is one utterance; separate utterances are separate dialogues |
| U+200B, U+FEFF inside text, U+00AD | remove | invisible format characters that only change bytes |
| other format characters (ZWJ, bidirectional controls) | reject with `InvisibleFormatCharacter { code_point }` | no Vietnamese need; a reviewed exception may add one |
| C0 and C1 controls | reject | never valid spoken text |
| punctuation (`…` / `...`, `“”` / `""`, `–` / `-`) | keep exactly | the author's choice; it may affect prosody |

A deliberate pause is not whitespace. If the schema models pauses, they are typed delivery data,
so collapsing whitespace never deletes a performance instruction. Whether display needs line
breaks inside a dialogue is a product question; report it rather than encoding a guess.

## 7. Pronunciation overrides are typed data

Inline markup in spoken text is a counterexample:

```text
"Chào mừng đến <phoneme ph=\"…\">Vọng Đài</phoneme>"    provider syntax inside content
"Hẹn gặp ở [TP.HCM|Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh] nhé."        a private mini-language inside content
```

It leaks provider syntax into the IR, shows up in displays and exports, makes a text fix and a
pronunciation fix indistinguishable in the diff and breaks when the provider changes syntax.
Model the override beside the text instead:

```rust
// Illustrative and proposed.
pub struct PronunciationOverride {
    target: OverrideTarget,
    rendering: Rendering,
}

pub enum OverrideTarget {
    Term { surface: SpokenText, occurrence: Occurrence }, // Occurrence::All | Nth(NonZeroU16)
}

pub enum Rendering {
    Respelling(SpokenText),                          // "TP.HCM" → "Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh"
    Phonemes { alphabet: PhonemeAlphabet, value: String },
    SayAs(SayAs),                                    // Characters | Cardinal | Ordinal | …
}
```

- The validator checks that the surface occurs in the line (NFC comparison) and that an `Nth`
  occurrence exists; an edit that removes the term yields `PronunciationTargetMissing { term }`
  instead of a silently dropped override. Overlapping targets are rejected.
- Line overrides belong to Script IR and enter `SpokenContent`. Adaptation- or character-wide
  pronunciation rules are a separately versioned profile resolved when production inputs freeze;
  where character pronunciation guidance lives is not yet decided in the docs.
- Mapping a `Rendering` to what a provider supports is the pipeline adapter's job
  ([architecture § Interfaces](../../../../docs/architecture/overview.md#interfaces)); an
  unsupported rendering is an explicit finding, never a silent drop.
- Mixed-language words, such as an English name in a `vi-VN` line, use an override. Per-span
  language tags are not modeled for the MVP; report a need rather than inventing one.

## 8. Tests

| Claim | Test | Evidence level |
|---|---|---|
| NFD and Windows-1258 forms never look like edits | vector table through every entry path → equal bytes, digest and empty diff | `example-tested` |
| normalization is total and idempotent | property over generated Vietnamese syllables, random composition | `property-tested` |
| tone placement variants stay distinct | vector pairs → different bytes | `example-tested` |
| whitespace policy | table test per row, exact output or exact rejection variant | `example-tested` |
| search folding | `nguoi dan`, `vong dai` hit; folded text never reaches the digest | `example-tested` |
| offset conversion | UTF-16 ↔ UTF-8 ↔ grapheme for the vectors; grapheme truncation never panics | `example-tested`, `property-tested` |
| pronunciation targets | removed term → `PronunciationTargetMissing`; overlap → rejection | `example-tested` |

Rendered diacritics, line height and font coverage are not proven by any of these; they need the
UI evidence loop in [`cantos-ui-design`](../../cantos-ui-design/SKILL.md).
