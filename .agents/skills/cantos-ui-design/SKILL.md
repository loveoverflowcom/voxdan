  Shared UI policy for Cantos Studio and Theatre on both renderers, Leptos Web and Compose
  Multiplatform: Material 3 Expressive as an attention system with a per-surface intensity
  model, the calm Lavender Stage identity, one versioned semantic token source mapped to CSS and
  Kotlin, Vietnamese-safe typography, intent-based motion with reduced motion, accessibility,
  vi-VN/en localization, component state matrices and inspected visual evidence. Use for visual
  design, tokens, color, type, shape, motion, copy, accessibility, UI states or screenshot
  review; routes renderer work to cantos-leptos-web and cantos-cmp-mobile.

# Cantos UI design

This skill owns the **working method** every Cantos screen shares on both renderers: how to decide
a screen's hierarchy, express it through semantic tokens and shared component contracts, keep
text, accessibility and motion correct, and prove the rendered result. It is a behavioral contract
and router. Renderer mechanics — Leptos components, CSS, DOM, Compose, native adapters — belong to
[`cantos-leptos-web`](../cantos-leptos-web/SKILL.md) and
[`cantos-cmp-mobile`](../cantos-cmp-mobile/SKILL.md).

It composes [`cantos-engineering`](../cantos-engineering/SKILL.md): the required order, the
[evidence vocabulary](../cantos-engineering/SKILL.md#6-never-collapse-evidence-into-the-word-verified)
and the [completion report](../cantos-engineering/SKILL.md#9-completion-report) are defined there
and reused here unchanged.

## Product truth lives in the docs

| Requirement | Owner |
|---|---|
| direction, token families and roles, Studio and Theatre regions, component states, accessibility and motion targets, validation matrix | [UI system](../../../docs/design/ui-system.md) |
| native semantics, focus order, large text, touch targets, safe areas, reduced motion on CMP | [mobile § UI and accessibility](../../../docs/architecture/mobile.md#ui-and-accessibility) |
| lavender/purple palette, rounded and pill controls, compact adaptive layouts, restraint | [brief § Design direction](../../../docs/product/brief.md#design-direction) |
| evidence a UI pull request carries | [CONTRIBUTING § UI changes](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md#ui-changes), [AGENTS.md § Verification](../../../AGENTS.md#verification) |
| meaning of playback, job, QC, approval and download states | the domain owners in [Compose with](#compose-with) |

Link these; never restate a competing copy of a target, token family or state list. When this
skill and a document disagree on product behavior, the document wins; report the conflict.

## Repository reality

No Leptos package, Gradle build, token source, generator, localization framework, font, icon set,
UI test harness or evidence directory exists, and the reference UI image named in the brief was
never attached. Therefore:

- every path, command, tool and API name in this skill is **proposed** or a **candidate**;
  discover the real manifests before citing one;
- no exact palette, type scale, shape size or spring constant is decided — never invent final hex
  values, sizes or curves; work with token *names* and *relationships*;
- no visual-fidelity claim is possible until the reference image and its viewport are captured in
  the design issue ([UI system § Direction and reference](../../../docs/design/ui-system.md#direction-and-reference));
- the first UI slice in the queue — 010.4, the accessible Studio script editor
  ([work item 010](../../../docs/work-plan/010-import-and-edit-script.md)) — inherits the
  first-slice decisions below.

| First-slice decision | Detailed in |
|---|---|
| token source location, format and generator for CSS and Kotlin | [`tokens.md`](references/tokens.md) |
| palette values with recorded contrast per theme; dynamic-color policy | [`tokens.md`](references/tokens.md), [`material3-expressive.md`](references/material3-expressive.md) |
| font family with verified Vietnamese coverage; type scale | [`typography.md`](references/typography.md) |
| localization framework, key convention, locale set confirmation | [`localization.md`](references/localization.md) |
| reduced-motion adapters and the motion mapping per renderer | [`motion.md`](references/motion.md) |
| capture tooling and an ignored evidence location | [`visual-review.md`](references/visual-review.md) |

Record each with [`templates/adr.md`](../../../templates/adr.md) or the design issue form; a
decision made silently inside a component is a defect.

## Route the work

| The change touches… | Load next | Evidence boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Studio or Theatre Web: Leptos view, CSS, DOM, browser media | [`cantos-leptos-web`](../cantos-leptos-web/SKILL.md) + the references here it needs | DOM and browser; never native |
| Theatre Android/iOS: Compose, `CantosTheme`, native adapters | [`cantos-cmp-mobile`](../cantos-cmp-mobile/SKILL.md) + the references here it needs | Compose semantics and named devices; never Web |
| a semantic token, shared component contract or shared copy key | [`tokens.md`](references/tokens.md), then **both** renderer skills | each consumer rendered and inspected; CSS proves nothing about Kotlin |
| a domain state shown in UI (playback, job, QC, approval, download) | the domain owner first, then [`component-states.md`](references/component-states.md) | the owner's tests for meaning; the UI only maps it |
| audit and findings report, no fixes | [`cantos-ui-inspector`](../cantos-ui-inspector/SKILL.md) | report-only |
| review of an existing diff | [`cantos-code-review`](../cantos-code-review/SKILL.md) | read-only; these references are criteria |

If you arrived here from a renderer skill, continue in that skill; do not reload it. A
documentation-only change to this skill needs no app render: validate links and routing, and say
that no production behavior was exercised.

## Material 3 Expressive is an attention system

Expressive design steers attention to what matters on *this* screen with five levers — **color,
shape, size, motion, containment** — while keeping familiar controls. It is not "round every
corner": a screen of equally loud pills has no hierarchy. Before styling, answer the intent
questions — primary goal, primary action, primary content, secondary tools, tone — and pick the
surface's intensity:

| Cantos surface | Intensity | Expression budget |
|---|---|---|
| Studio script editor, work navigation | Low | text dominates; quiet tools; stable rectangular reading areas; no card per utterance |
| Studio production status, QC, approval, publish | Low-Medium | trust and clarity; explicit revision identity; confirmations name episode and revision |
| Studio casting and voice preview | Medium | selected voice and preview action stand out; still one primary action |
| Theatre discovery and library | Medium | cover art, title and availability lead; no oversized banners or gradients |
| Theatre full player | Medium-High | expressive transport: size and shape morph on play/pause; playback state always legible |
| Theatre mini-player | Medium-Low | compact, persistent, never obscures content or focus |

No MVP surface is High; adding one is a product decision. The identity is **Lavender Stage**, a
working label for the direction in the docs: soft lavender/purple brand, low-chroma reading
surfaces, one primary action hue per screen, status never by color alone, dark theme designed
rather than inverted, and dynamic color that never silently replaces the identity. Depth,
M3 Expressive specifics and the candidate-component table: [`material3-expressive.md`](references/material3-expressive.md).

Token *names* map one semantic role to each renderer; values stay open. Illustrative only:

| Semantic role (doc-owned) | Leptos Web (proposed) | CMP (proposed) |
|---|---|---|
| `color.primary` / `color.onPrimary` | `--cantos-color-primary` / `--cantos-color-on-primary` | generated `ColorScheme.primary` / `onPrimary` |
| `color.surfaceContainer` | `--cantos-color-surface-container` | generated `ColorScheme.surfaceContainer` |
| `color.success`, `color.warning`, `color.focus` | `--cantos-color-success`, … | `CantosTheme.extendedColors` — M3 `ColorScheme` has no such roles |
| `type.body` | `--cantos-type-body-size`, `-line-height`, `-weight` | one mapping to a `Typography` style, chosen once |
| `shape.pill` | `--cantos-shape-pill` | `CantosTheme.shapes.pill` |
| `motion.feedback` | duration/easing pair or JS spring parameters | spring spec from the motion mapping |

## Shared UI loop

Every UI change follows this order on either renderer. Skipping a step is a decision you state.

```text
1  name the screen/flow, its surface intensity and its consumers (Web, CMP or both)
2  keep domain decisions out of UI: the backend or core decides, the UI renders typed facts
3  implement through semantic tokens and shared component contracts (renderer skill for mechanics)
4  localize every visible and accessibility string, in every required locale
5  add the cheapest deterministic test for the changed behavior (presentation mapping, state matrix)
6  render the production surface, drive the affected states, capture and open the images
7  fix at the responsible owner and recheck the same scenario, unchanged
8  format and lint with each touched toolchain
9  report with the completion report below
```

1. **Name it.** Route, screen, flow and every consumer of a touched token, component or key;
   write the intent answers and the intensity row. Seed the ledger from the
   [validation matrix](../../../docs/design/ui-system.md#future-validation-matrix).
2. **Decouple.** Approval staleness, publish eligibility, regeneration scope, cost, progress
   reconciliation and permissions are decided by the backend or a pure core
   ([foundation § 4](../cantos-engineering/SKILL.md#4-functional-core-imperative-shell)). The UI
   receives values such as `Unavailable(BlockingQcFindings)` and maps them through a pure,
   exhaustive presentation function. Element state (open menu, focus, scroll) stays local.
3. **Implement through contracts.** Consume semantic roles, never literals or reference tones;
   reuse a component whose contract fits; never hand-edit generated token output.
4. **Localize.** Semantic keys, parameters instead of concatenation, plural rules in resources,
   mapped errors instead of raw provider or internal text; accessibility labels included.
5. **Test cheaply.** A table test over every variant of the presentation mapping, then the
   renderer's DOM or semantics test for names and states; see [Evidence selection](#evidence-selection).
6. **Render and inspect.** Realistic Vietnamese content (`Người dẫn chuyện`,
   `Ngày mai, mình có diễn tiếp không?`, `Ánh đèn cuối sân khấu`), the changed states, the
   viewports, themes and text scales the change can affect; open each image and record findings
   with [`visual-review.md`](references/visual-review.md).
7. **Recheck the same scenario.** Same fixture, viewport, theme, locale, text scale and state; only
   the source differs. A scenario changed between runs proves nothing about the fix.
8. **Format.** Each touched toolchain's formatter in check mode, then lint and tests.
9. **Report** every UI field, including what was not observed.

## Rules

Enforcement today is manual for every rule: no UI code or gate exists. "Proposed" names the oracle
to automate when the first UI slice lands.

| Rule | Failure mode | Good / counterexample | Oracle · enforcement | Exception |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **UI-INTENT** write intent answers and intensity before styling | equal-weight chrome; decoration mistaken for hierarchy | full player: "goal keep listening; primary play/pause; secondary speed, timer, bookmark, download; Medium-High" / adding a gradient and rounder cards "to look expressive" | orientation test on inspected captures · manual | copy-only change with no layout effect |
| **UI-CORE** the UI renders typed facts and never decides domain state | Web and CMP diverge; a UI-only gate is bypassable | API returns `Unavailable(StaleApproval { approved, current })` / Leptos comparing revision numbers to decide staleness | review for duplicated rules; mapping table test · manual | presentation-only state at its lifetime |
| **UI-TOKEN** visual values come from one versioned semantic source; generated output is never hand-edited; a role change maps both consumers | Web/CMP palette drift; theme change misses literals | `var(--cantos-color-primary)` / a hex literal in a component; patching generated Kotlin | drift test and literal scan (proposed) · manual | renderer-local geometry with a stated reason |
| **UI-STRING** every visible and accessibility string is a localized resource with a semantic key | untranslatable UI; English fallbacks; leaked provider errors | `studio.publish.action` in vi-VN and en / `"Publish"` literal; `error.to_string()` shown | literal scan, key and placeholder parity (proposed) · manual | logs and developer-only diagnostics |
| **UI-STATE** each component has a state matrix; disabled carries a reason; status is never color alone | dead-end controls; QC blocks invisible to color-blind users | icon + text + tone for `Blocking`, reason beside a disabled Publish / grey button, red dot only | matrix tests and per-state captures · manual | — |
| **UI-A11Y** names state action + item + state; focus visible, contained, restored; drag and gestures have alternatives | keyboard or screen-reader dead ends; focus lost after dialogs | `Phát tập 3: Một lời hẹn` / an unnamed ▶ icon | `accessibility-checked`; `screen-reader-walked` only when it happened · manual | — |
| **UI-MOTION** motion uses intent tokens, never delays an action or moves a target under the user, stays interruptible; reduced motion keeps feedback | blocked or mis-tapped input; vestibular harm | play dispatches on press and the morph decorates it / waiting for the morph to finish | exhaustive motion-spec test (proposed), runtime recording · manual | — |
| **UI-PIXELS** a visual claim needs opened, attributed captures of the changed states and a same-scenario recheck | "it compiles" passes for "it looks right" | before/after at the same 320 CSS px, dark, vi-VN / rechecking with a shorter English string | review ledger · manual | no rendered effect |

## Evidence selection

Use the foundation vocabulary verbatim; this table only selects among it.

| Claim | Cheapest suitable evidence | Level | Does not prove |
|---|---|---|---|
| domain state → label, icon, tone, availability | exhaustive match + table test over every variant | `statically-checked`, `example-tested` | rendering |
| paired token roles meet the contrast floors per theme | contrast checker over the token source (proposed) | `example-tested` | contrast over images, scrims, gradients |
| generated CSS and Kotlin match the source | regenerate-and-diff drift test (proposed) | `statically-checked` | that components consume the roles |
| a component exposes the right name, role, state | DOM test on Web; Compose UI test naming its renderer | `DOM-tested`, `semantics-tested` | pixels, screen readers |
| a flow works by input | events driven through the real flow | `interaction-tested` | screen readers, other targets |
| keyboard, focus and semantics | driven keyboard/focus walk plus semantics assertions | `accessibility-checked` | real assistive technology |
| a screen reader can operate it | named TalkBack/VoiceOver/NVDA walkthrough | `screen-reader-walked` | other readers or versions |
| layout, theme, locale, text scale | capture **and open** each image | `screenshot-inspected`, `cross-viewport-inspected`, `cross-theme-inspected` | interaction, motion, semantics |
| motion, interruption, reduced motion | recording or frame profile on the target while reversing mid-flight | `interaction-tested` or `device-tested`, artifact in provenance | smoothness on other hardware |
| insets, back, native input, media controls | run on a named device, emulator or simulator | `device-tested` | other OS versions |

Captured but unopened images stay `screenshot-captured`. A desktop or JVM render is never
`device-tested`. A screenshot never establishes accessibility, motion or interaction. There is no
separate "motion verified" level: report the recording as provenance under the level it supports.

## Completion report

Report blocked evidence as blocked. A missing reference image, renderer, device or screen reader
belongs on the residual-risk line, never in silence.
