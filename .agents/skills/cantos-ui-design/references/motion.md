# Motion

Requirements are owned by the [UI system](../../../../docs/design/ui-system.md#semantic-tokens)
(Motion row), [§ Accessibility and motion acceptance](../../../../docs/design/ui-system.md#accessibility-and-motion-acceptance)
and the Motion row of the [validation matrix](../../../../docs/design/ui-system.md#future-validation-matrix).
Curves, durations and spring constants are open; choose and profile framework-supported
mechanisms during implementation.

## 1. Intent tokens

Motion is specified by **intent**, not by curve. Each token names why something moves; the
renderer mapping decides how.

| Token | Communicates | Cantos examples | Default mapping | Under reduced motion |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `motion.feedback` | an input was received; a small state changed | play/pause morph, bookmark toggle, chip selection, saved indicator | fast spatial + fast effects | final state at once; effects-only change allowed |
| `motion.navigation` | where something came from or went | mini ↔ full player, inspector pane, sheets, route changes | default spatial + default effects | crossfade or instant swap; no travel |
| `motion.emphasis` | one important arrival on this screen | full-player transport settling on open, a resume prompt appearing | slow spatial, expressive scheme only in Theatre | no overshoot, no travel |
| `motion.reduced` | the substitution policy for every intent when the user asks for less motion | — | § 4 | — |

`motion.emphasis` is a budget: at most one emphasized arrival per screen, never in Studio's
editor, status, QC or publish surfaces.

## 2. Springs and schemes

Material 3 Expressive specifies motion as springs. **Spatial** springs animate position, size,
rotation and shape and may overshoot; **effects** springs animate color and opacity and never
overshoot. Each family has fast, default and slow speeds inside a **standard** scheme (calm,
little bounce) or an **expressive** scheme (visible overshoot).

| Surface | Scheme | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Studio, every region | standard | a reading and accountability tool; bounce reads as noise |
| Theatre library, detail, settings | standard | browsing and decisions |
| Theatre full-player transport, mini ↔ full transition | expressive spatial permitted | the Medium-High surface; still interruptible and reducible |

Two laws hold for every spec, whatever the values become: effects springs are critically damped
or more (damping ratio ≥ 1, so no overshoot); under reduced motion no spatial property travels.
Check them once on the token source so neither renderer can drift ([`tokens.md`](tokens.md)).

Renderer reality: Compose has spring specs and Material motion-scheme APIs (verify in the pinned
CMP artifact). The Web has no native spring: CSS transitions cover effects and simple spatial
changes and retarget from the current value but drop velocity; CSS `linear()` can approximate a
spring curve; a small JavaScript animator is needed only where interruption must preserve
velocity, such as a dragged player sheet. Mechanics belong to the renderer skills.

## 3. Rules

| Rule | Failure mode | Good | Counterexample | Oracle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Never delay an action** | the input feels ignored; rapid taps are lost | play/pause dispatches the command on press; the morph decorates a state already changed | starting playback in an animation-end callback; navigation waiting for an exit animation before loading | interaction test asserts the command and state immediately after input, before the clock advances |
| **Never move a target during interaction** | mis-taps; lost place while reading | status and download states reserve their space; time text uses tabular figures; the mini-player never appears under a finger mid-scroll | a job-status update reflowing the episode list while the pointer is down | driven test compares target bounds before and after an async update (proposed) |
| **Stay interruptible** | the user waits for animation or fights it | reversing the full-player expansion mid-flight retargets from the current value; a dragged sheet follows the finger and settles with its velocity | input locked until a transition ends | reverse at mid-flight under a controlled clock; assert final state equals the last intent |
| **State is never carried by motion alone** | a still frame or a screen reader misses the change | the final frame and the semantics show "Đã tạm dừng" / paused | a pulse as the only sign of a new QC finding | still capture plus semantics or DOM assertion of the end state |
| **Continuous motion only for ongoing activity** | distraction, battery drain, vestibular harm | a loading indicator while an episode opens; it stops when loaded, offscreen or backgrounded | an endless shimmer in Studio; a marquee title in the mini-player | recording shows the loop end; reduced-motion run shows none |
| **Static surfaces do not fake clickability** | people try to click explanations | press and hover feedback only on real controls | hover lift on an informational card | inspected hover/press states |

## 4. Reduced motion

| Platform | Signal | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Web | `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` (CSS and `matchMedia` for script-driven animation) | emulate in browser developer tools for repeatable runs |
| Android | the system "remove animations" accessibility setting and animator duration scale | verify what the pinned Compose version honors by itself |
| iOS | Reduce Motion | reach it through a platform adapter |

CMP has no common reduced-motion API to rely on: expose a `MotionPreference` from a platform
adapter at the composition root and pass it down as a value. Never read the OS setting inside a
component.

| Remove | Keep |
|---|---|
| travel, slide-ins, container transforms | the state change itself, immediately |
| overshoot and bounce | color and opacity changes (short or instant) |
| parallax and zooms | focus rings, pressed and selected states |
| shape-morph travel (swap to the final shape) | progress text and determinate progress updates |
| continuous loops and decorative indicators (replace with static indicator + text) | announcements of significant changes |

The mapping from intent and preference to a spec is a pure function — the functional core of
motion — and its laws are a bounded exhaustive test:

```kotlin
// Illustrative, proposed — no motion module exists yet.
enum class MotionIntent { Feedback, Navigation, Emphasis }
enum class AnimatedProperty { Spatial, Effects }
enum class MotionPreference { Full, Reduced }

sealed interface MotionSpec {
    data object Instant : MotionSpec
    data class Spring(val dampingRatio: Float, val stiffness: Float) : MotionSpec
}

fun motionFor(
    intent: MotionIntent,
    property: AnimatedProperty,
    preference: MotionPreference,
    tokens: MotionTokens,
): MotionSpec = when (property) {
    AnimatedProperty.Effects -> tokens.effects(intent)
    AnimatedProperty.Spatial -> when (preference) {
        MotionPreference.Full -> tokens.spatial(intent)
        MotionPreference.Reduced -> MotionSpec.Instant
    }
}

@Test
fun reducedMotionNeverTravelsAndEffectsNeverOvershoot() {
    for (intent in MotionIntent.entries) {
        for (preference in MotionPreference.entries) {
            val spatial = motionFor(intent, AnimatedProperty.Spatial, preference, CantosMotionTokens)
            val effects = motionFor(intent, AnimatedProperty.Effects, preference, CantosMotionTokens)
            if (preference == MotionPreference.Reduced) assertEquals(MotionSpec.Instant, spatial)
            if (effects is MotionSpec.Spring) {
                assertTrue(effects.dampingRatio >= 1f, "effects spring overshoots for $intent")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The exhaustive `when` is the type-level half of the proof: adding a property or a preference fails
compilation until the mapping handles it, and the token lookups match exhaustively on the intent
the same way.

Leptos needs the same mapping in Rust; generate both from the token source rather than
hand-maintaining two tables.

## 5. Cantos motion patterns

| Pattern | Full motion | Reduced motion | Never |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Play / pause** (feedback) | command on press; primary control morphs shape (fast spatial) while the icon crossfades (fast effects); the accessible name switches immediately (`Phát` ↔ `Tạm dừng`) | instant shape and icon swap | waiting for the morph; showing "playing" for buffering — intent and actual state differ ([`playback-semantics.md`](../../cantos-listening/references/playback-semantics.md)) |
| **Mini ↔ full player** (navigation) | the mini-player expands into the full player as one container, content crossfades; drag down collapses, following the finger; Back or Escape collapses; focus moves to the full-player heading and returns to the expand control on collapse | crossfade or instant swap, same focus behavior | re-creating the media session or audio element; moving the play control under a pressed finger; blocking input until settled |
| **Seek** | none while dragging: the thumb follows the pointer and the elapsed text updates; no spring-back on release | identical | animating the thumb with overshoot after a keyboard step |
| **Episode and download state updates** | effects-only color and icon change in reserved space | instant | reordering rows under the user; growing a row when "Đang tải xuống 42%" appears |
| **Studio job status** | effects-only change; determinate progress updates; announcement handled separately ([`accessibility.md`](accessibility.md#6-announcements-without-spam)) | instant | minute-long spinners; bouncing badges; motion inside the script text |
| **Studio inspector pane** | navigation intent; the editor keeps its scroll anchor, selection and caret while the column resizes | instant | reflowing lines under the caret without restoring position |
| **Dialogs and sheets** | scrim fades (effects); sheet enters spatially | fade or instant | moving the confirm button after the dialog opens |

## 6. Evidence

A still image cannot demonstrate smoothness, interruption or reduced motion. Split the claim:

| Part of the claim | Evidence | Level |
|---|---|---|
| the right spec for each intent and preference | the exhaustive test in § 4 | `example-tested` (bounded exhaustive) |
| the command commits before animation; reversal lands on the last intent | controlled-clock UI test: Compose test clock with auto-advance off; on the Web, assert the state change synchronously after the event | `interaction-tested` |
| it looks and feels right on the target | screen recording at a known frame rate plus frame-timing data from the platform profiler (browser performance panel; Android and iOS frame and hitch tooling — candidates), with device or browser, build and scenario recorded | `interaction-tested` or `device-tested`; the recording is provenance |
| reduced motion works | the **same** scenario rerun with the OS or browser setting on; the recording shows no travel, overshoot or loops | as above |

There is no "motion verified" level. A recording on one device says nothing about slower
hardware; a desktop CMP run says nothing about Android or iOS. Name what was observed and put the
rest on the residual-risk line.
