# Contributing to Cantos

Cantos combines an audio-drama production Studio with a Theatre listening experience. Read the [project overview](README.md) before proposing a change. The repository starts with planning documents and templates; implementation status and supported commands must be documented as the runtime is added.

## Branch and pull request workflow

`develop` is the default and integration branch. Create focused branches from its latest revision and open pull requests back to `develop`. A `main` branch is not required for this workflow.

```bash
git fetch origin
git switch develop
git pull --ff-only origin develop
git switch -c feat/scene-casting
```

Use a short, descriptive branch name such as `feat/scene-casting`, `fix/player-progress`, or `docs/production-workflow`. Keep unrelated changes in separate pull requests. For a large feature, define its dependencies and divide it into changes that each have an observable outcome.

Use the pull request template to explain the resulting behavior, verification, compatibility, and production impact. Do not treat a passed repository check as evidence that an unimplemented application builds or runs.

## Plan and track work

Use the GitHub issue forms for implementation tasks, bugs, design work, and production quality control. Use the [document templates](templates/README.md) when a decision or production run needs a durable record. Link related issues and documents so prerequisites and unresolved questions remain visible.

An implementation task should specify:

- The creator or listener outcome and a bounded scope.
- Observable acceptance criteria, including relevant error and recovery behavior.
- Dependencies, contract changes, and compatibility expectations.
- The evidence needed to verify the change.

Do not invent labels, reviewer identities, provider accounts, or approval policies. Establish these explicitly when the project needs them.

## Architecture and contracts

Keep the initial architecture modular without introducing microservices prematurely. Separate domain rules, provider adapters, production orchestration, storage, APIs, and app presentation through explicit interfaces.

Treat the versioned Script IR as the boundary for exchanging narrative data with Narrative Forge. Reuse concepts and documented contracts rather than importing another project's internal modules. Record schema compatibility, migration behavior, and stable identities for works, episodes, scenes, and dialogue segments before changing persisted data.

Rust backend and Kotlin mobile code may share generated API contracts where practical. Document the source of truth and generation process when selecting that tooling; do not assume Rust types can be consumed directly by Kotlin. Keep platform audio playback native on Android and iOS.

## Production changes

Make pipeline work resumable and verifiable. State which input revision a job processes, how retries avoid duplicate generation or publication, and which dialogue or scene assets a change invalidates. Report provider cost impact and preserve the ability to preview corrections before publication.

Never include private manuscripts, credentials, signed storage URLs, or unauthorized voice/music assets in commits, logs, issue attachments, or fixtures. Use original or permitted examples. Publication must wait for the applicable rights, QC, and approval checks documented for that production run.

## UI changes

Follow the project design direction: Material 3 Expressive, soft lavender/purple colors, compact adaptive layouts, expressive rounded controls, accessible typography, and restrained borders and shadows.

Attach the relevant reference and before/after evidence to design work. Cover keyboard and touch input, contrast, focus behavior, reduced motion, and applicable narrow/wide layouts. Document which tokens and components should be shared between Leptos and CMP and which interactions depend on native platform behavior.

## Verification

Run the repository consistency checks and their tests from the repository root:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_repository.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_*.py'
git diff --check
```

For the implemented Script IR contract, use Rust 1.87 and run `cargo fmt --all -- --check`,
`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace --locked`
and `python3 scripts/reference_script_ir.py`. See [the contract](contracts/README.md) for the
CLI, fixture-authoring and bounded mutation commands. On affected macOS temporary-path setups,
run Python tests with `TMPDIR=/private/tmp`.

For runtime changes, run the relevant stack-specific checks once the corresponding implementation and tooling exist. Include meaningful integration evidence for job retry/resume, partial regeneration, publishing, streaming, and native background playback when those behaviors change. Record any environment limitations instead of claiming an unrun check passed.
