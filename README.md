# Cantos

**Vọng Đài — Theatre of Voices.** An AI-assisted audio drama platform with a creator Studio and a podcast-like Theatre for listeners.

Cantos produces performances with a cast, narration, atmosphere, music and sound effects. Published audio is rendered once and streamed from stored assets; listening does not call a TTS provider.

## Repository status

This repository contains product specifications, architecture decisions, directory guides and
project-management templates, plus an executable Rust [Script IR contract](contracts/README.md)
and validation CLI. A local development Axum/PostgreSQL revision store and minimal live Leptos
Studio consumer now save and read complete immutable exports with actor permissions,
optimistic concurrency and idempotent retries. See the [persistence evidence](docs/evidence/script-revision-persistence.md).
The compatible [editorial handoff](docs/evidence/editorial-handoff.md) adds private preserved
sources, bounded history, owner review records and operator credential tools on that backend.
Bounded manuscript import preserves TXT, Markdown, DOCX and Script IR originals with a minimal
Studio comparison flow; see the [import evidence](docs/evidence/manuscript-import.md).
The bounded adaptation implementation exports immutable source/revision context through
[authenticated HTTP/CLI tools](contracts/adaptation-v1.md), validates host-created proposals,
and supports explicit Studio review/acceptance. Gemini / ChatGPT / Codex generation belongs to
the user-controlled host; Cantos performs no inference. [Adaptation evidence](docs/evidence/ai-script-adaptation.md)
separates actual tool/storage tests from synthetic content and unrun model quality. The [structured Studio editor](docs/evidence/studio-script-editor.md) adds scene/dialogue/character authoring,
validation previews, source comparison and revision history on that same authority. Production,
Theatre and native mobile playback remain planned. No runnable Gradle project or production
identity deployment is claimed.

`develop` is the first and default branch. Create short-lived feature branches from it and target pull requests to `develop`.

## Product and stack

| Surface | Purpose | Technology |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cantos Studio | Import, adapt, edit, cast, preview, produce and approve episodes | Leptos Web |
| Cantos Theatre | Discover and listen to published audio drama | Leptos Web; Kotlin Compose Multiplatform on Android/iOS |
| Backend | Domain rules, APIs, production orchestration and publication | Rust, Axum, PostgreSQL |
| Media delivery | Private production assets and approved episode renditions | S3-compatible object storage and CDN |

Start with one modular backend. Worker execution can run separately for resource isolation while sharing the same codebase and PostgreSQL job model.

## Start here

- [Project brief](docs/product/brief.md) and [business rules](docs/product/business-rules.md).
- [Architecture](docs/architecture/overview.md), [Script IR](docs/architecture/script-ir.md) and [production pipeline](docs/product/production-pipeline.md).
- [UI system](docs/design/ui-system.md) and [native mobile requirements](docs/architecture/mobile.md).
- [Ordered MVP work plan](docs/work-plan/README.md): the next implementation step and its review boundary.
- [GitHub planning guide](docs/work-plan/project-planning.md), [Kanban](https://github.com/users/loveoverflowcom/projects/6/views/1) and [Planning table](https://github.com/users/loveoverflowcom/projects/6/views/2): 17 implementation issues across five milestones.
- [Contributor workflow](CONTRIBUTING.md), [agent instructions](AGENTS.md), [agent skills](.agents/skills/README.md) and [reusable templates](templates/README.md).

## Validate the bootstrap

```sh
python3 scripts/check_repository.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_*.py'
git diff --check
```

Verify the implemented contract with Rust 1.87:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --locked
python3 scripts/reference_script_ir.py
cargo run --locked --bin validate-script -- contracts/fixtures/script-ir/0.1.0/accept/two-scenes.json
```

[Contract evidence](docs/evidence/script-ir-contract.md) names the actual verification boundary.
On macOS where temporary symlink tests encounter `/var` versus `/private/var`, use
`TMPDIR=/private/tmp` for the Python unit/mutation runs.

Verify the persistence slice against a fresh disposable PostgreSQL cluster (never an inherited
`DATABASE_URL`), then build the browser target:

```sh
PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@17/bin:$PATH" python3 scripts/test_postgres.py
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain 1.87.0
cargo clippy -p cantos-studio --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --locked -- -D warnings
cd apps/web
NO_COLOR=true trunk build --locked
```

[Server](apps/server/README.md) and [Studio](apps/web/README.md) describe migration, test-role
permissions and local serving. PostgreSQL binaries must be on `PATH`; the Homebrew path above is
Mac-specific. [.env.example](.env.example) distinguishes implemented development configuration
from future provider/storage configuration; no dotenv loader or audio QA runtime is provided.

Measure the implemented revision reads against synthetic data in a fresh disposable cluster:

```sh
PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@17/bin:$PATH" python3 scripts/benchmark_revision_reads.py --scripts 100
PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@17/bin:$PATH" python3 scripts/benchmark_revision_reads.py --scripts 5000
```

The [benchmark protocol](docs/evidence/script-revision-benchmark-protocol.md) records the
chosen local budgets, snapshot isolation between comparisons and shared-buffer cold-start
limitations. The harness stops its HTTP/PostgreSQL processes and retains raw synthetic
samples/plans locally under ignored `target/read-benchmarks/`. It never accepts an existing DB URL.

## MVP completion

The MVP must demonstrate an authorized script imported into Studio, reviewed adaptation and casting, resumable production, partial regeneration, mixed audio passing QC, approved publication, Theatre Web playback and native Android/iOS listening with background controls, offline playback and synchronized progress. See the [work plan](docs/work-plan/README.md) for individual acceptance gates.

The referenced UI image was not attached to this request. Exact visual matching remains pending receipt of that reference. The lavender/purple, compact Material 3 Expressive direction is recorded in the UI specification.

## Licensing and content

A software license has not been selected. Do not infer redistribution permission from repository visibility. Source works, adaptations, voices, music and sound effects have separate rights records; production or publication approval must be tied to their exact revisions.
