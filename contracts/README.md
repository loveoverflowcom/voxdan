# Contracts

This directory owns versioned interchange descriptions and representative fixtures. Script IR
`0.1.0` has a hand-authored [JSON Schema](schema/script-ir/0.1.0.schema.json), a
[Rust reader and semantic validator](../apps/server/src/script_ir/mod.rs), and
[Vietnamese fixtures](fixtures/script-ir/0.1.0). This implements the contract part of
[#1](https://github.com/loveoverflowcom/cantos/issues/1). The [Studio v1 contract](studio-v1.md)
now serves the Axum/PostgreSQL store and Leptos consumer through shared raw Rust DTOs,
JSON Schema and serialized fixtures. No generated Kotlin bindings are claimed.

The [manuscript import v1 contract](manuscript-v1.md) adds a private, immutable source intake
receipt for TXT, Markdown, DOCX and validated Script IR. It uses the existing source registry,
separates exact original bytes from normalized extraction, and never saves a script revision or
grants publication permission automatically. Its hand-authored Schema and independent literal
wire examples are checked by the shared consumer and backend contract tests.

The [adaptation v1 contract](adaptation-v1.md) adds private revision-pinned runs, a closed
provider proposal format and explicit reviewed acceptance. Server-created IDs/evidence and the
existing Script IR reader form the admission boundary. Proposal citation coverage and findings
stay outside Script IR and require source comparison. The [tool schemas](adaptation-tools-v1.json) expose source-bound context/read/submit/review
operations over the existing authenticated HTTP service and CLI. Caller provenance is declared,
unverified evidence; no inference integration or live model result is implied.

The historical [draft example](examples/episode-draft.json) stays byte-for-byte unchanged. Its
`0.1.0-draft` version is illustrative and explicitly unsupported by the reader. The new fixtures
reuse that original sample and add synthetic content. Their external record IDs are placeholders;
passing validation does not establish production or distribution rights.

## Read and write policy

Read exactly `{0.1.0}`; write `0.1.0`. Missing and unsupported versions fail explicitly. An
unsupported-version error reports the found and supported versions; use a compatible producer
or a reviewed converter. Unknown fields fail at every object level. New fields, enum values or
units require a new exact schema version, a compatibility corpus and a deliberate converter or
rejection policy. Retiring a supported read version requires an owner decision and migration
plan; retain its compatibility fixtures. No converter, persisted older revision or retired
supported version exists.

The Schema owns shape (types, required fields, spellings, bounds). Rust is authoritative for
cross-reference and text semantics. Rust independently checks shape; differential tests compare
it with the Schema over fixtures, missing/unknown/null fields and boundary values. Consumers must
run semantic validation even when their JSON Schema tool accepts a document.

The [contract ADR](../docs/decisions/0002-script-ir-contract.md) is **proposed for production
adoption**, with these choices implemented and locally tested. This is the first experimental
contract, not approval of an application or publication gate.

## Identity, order and evidence

- Work, adaptation, episode, act, scene, dialogue, cue, character and provenance entry IDs are
  globally unique within one document: 1–64 ASCII characters from `[a-z0-9_-]`. The shell mints
  opaque IDs and preserves them across edits. The validator cannot infer whether a producer
  regenerated IDs between documents without a base revision.
- Acts, scenes and dialogues use array order. Each level is non-empty; there are no ordinal
  fields to drift out of sync. Cue array order breaks ties at an anchor. A cue anchor resolves
  to a dialogue in that same scene. Moving scenes/lines retains IDs.
- Every dialogue resolves its `speaker_id` to a character; exactly one character has the
  `narrator` role. Narration is ordinary spoken dialogue. Casting is external to the IR.
- Work `source_ref` and adaptation `provenance_refs` resolve to provenance entries; duplicate
  adaptation references fail. Every entry carries an external preserved `source_record_id` and
  `rights_record_id`. Generated provenance also requires `generation_record_id` for the recorded
  attempt. The adaptation's declared provenance applies to the whole episode. Adaptation runs
  separately record source-block citation coverage and review findings; those model claims do
  not prove faithful meaning or reliable omission detection.
- Work, adaptation and a selected cue asset require rights record references. Cue `asset.id`
  identifies an immutable asset record; an absent asset is an editorial intent. No URLs, media
  bytes, casting, rights status, revision numbers or workflow status belong in the IR. Backend
  adapters must resolve records, check tenant/actor access and evaluate rights at each gate.

Language tags are the bounded initial set `vi`, `vi-VN`, `en`, `en-US`; this does not promise
provider support. Delivery uses a closed emotion vocabulary and integer `intensity_permille`
from 0 to 1000. JSON Schema also admits integer-valued spellings such as `300.0`/`3e2`; Rust
normalizes them to an integer before canonical encoding using the exact decimal token, without
binary-float rounding. Fractional values (including tiny nonzero exponents) fail. Schema tools
that use binary floats may accept a rounded value; the byte reader remains authoritative for
that numeric boundary. Pronunciation
overrides are provider-neutral `{surface, replacement}` respellings of every left-to-right,
non-overlapping occurrence. Targets must occur in normalized text, and targets from different
overrides must not overlap. Phoneme alphabets, offsets and provider markup are not interpreted.

The reader limits input to 2 MiB before decoding and complete normalized exports to the same
bound before returning content. NFC expansion cannot create an unreadable or unstorable export.
Arrays are bounded at 10,000 entries; text at
10,000 Unicode scalar values both before and after normalization. These are parser/storage
bounds, not user-facing grapheme or provider request limits. JSON Schema cannot enforce the
byte limit or reject duplicate JSON object keys after another parser has discarded them; the
Rust byte reader rejects both. Serde's default recursion limit remains enabled.

## Text and diagnostics

Draft admission trims and collapses the frozen Unicode White_Space set to ASCII space (C1 NEL
is rejected), removes U+200B/U+FEFF/U+00AD, then applies NFC using Unicode 16.0.0 tables. Tabs
and line breaks become spaces. Other C0/C1 controls and the explicit invisible/format ranges in
[the validator](../apps/server/src/script_ir/validation.rs) are rejected. This bounded admission
profile is not an exhaustive Unicode security filter. NFC preserves punctuation and tone
placement: `hòa` and `hoà` remain distinct. Source bytes are kept outside Git and never normalized.

Semantic errors accumulate in fixed traversal order: work, adaptation references, narrator count,
characters, episode/acts/scenes/dialogues/cues, provenance IDs. Paths use stable IDs where known;
lists without identities use indexes. Shape errors use JSON Pointers; deserialization failures
include a line, column and cause. Shape failure stops before semantic validation. Studio HTTP
maps errors to stable codes/paths without exposing manuscript diagnostic payloads. Bracketed spoken text is retained; detecting cue-like markup for human
review remains editor/importer work.

## Canonical bytes and digest c1

The explicit Rust encoder uses compact UTF-8 JSON, fixed ASCII object keys in sorted order,
minimal string escaping, NFC text and integer values. It emits no BOM or trailing newline.
Characters/provenance sets sort by ID; provenance reference sets sort by ID; non-overlapping
pronunciation overrides sort by surface. Semantic sequence arrays retain their order. Empty
optional arrays and absent assets are omitted; explicit `null` is rejected on admission.

| Field family | Content bytes/digest | Per-line speech bytes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All editorial IDs, titles, character name/role/personality | included | excluded |
| Act, scene, dialogue and cue order | included | excluded |
| Adaptation language; line text, delivery, pronunciation | included | included |
| Speaker reference | included | beside speech bytes for casting resolution |
| Cue kind, description, anchor, selected asset ID | included | excluded |
| Schema version; provenance/source/generation and rights references | excluded | excluded |

`canonical_bytes()` returns the content projection, which is **not a complete interchange file**.
`export_bytes()` returns a complete canonical `0.1.0` document including provenance and rights
references. `read_canonical_script()` admits only those exact export bytes; a stored-row adapter
must reject corruption instead of silently normalizing it. JSONB reformatting is not suitable for
that byte-exact read path.

```text
ContentDigest = "sir-c1:sha256:" + lowercase_hex(
    SHA256(b"cantos/script-content/c1\n" + canonical_content_bytes)
)
```

Digest and schema versions evolve independently. A field classification or encoding change
requires a new digest scheme and new goldens; stored digests/bytes must never be rewritten.
Only c1 is constructible today, so typed comparisons are always within c1. A future multi-scheme
reader must refuse comparisons across schemes. Speech bytes exclude IDs, position and neighbors;
the pipeline must add voice/casting revisions, provider/model, settings and output profiles before
using them as a cache key.

Rights/provenance changes can leave the content digest unchanged. Persist the **complete** export
and bind approvals/production to an immutable revision ID plus its digest and resolved evidence.
Never deduplicate revisions or verify evidence integrity by content digest alone. Authorization,
rights expiry, casting completeness and publication readiness are not proved by this validator.

## Run and verify

From the repository root with Rust 1.87 and Python 3:

```sh
cargo run --locked --bin validate-script -- contracts/fixtures/script-ir/0.1.0/accept/two-scenes.json
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --locked
python3 scripts/reference_script_ir.py
python3 scripts/mutate_script_ir.py
```

The CLI returns 0 plus the digest on success, 1 for rejected content and 2 for usage/I/O failure.
`--export` writes the complete canonical file; `--content` writes only the digest projection.
`cases.json` records literal rejection oracles. Accepted `.expected.json` files hold content
bytes, digest and speech bytes produced by the independent Python JSON/SHA-256 oracle. Deliberate
regeneration uses `python3 scripts/reference_script_ir.py --write-goldens`; tests never update them.
The mutation runner checks nine named substitutions in a disposable offline copy.

See [contract evidence](../docs/evidence/script-ir-contract.md) and
[revision evidence](../docs/evidence/script-revision-persistence.md). Studio v1 uses hand-authored
DTOs checked against the same Schema/fixtures in both native and browser-consumer tests; it is
not generated OpenAPI. Future generated bindings must name their source and generation command.
