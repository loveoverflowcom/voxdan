# Studio revision API v1

Implemented development boundary: [Axum](../apps/server/src/http.rs) →
[PostgreSQL](../apps/server/src/postgres.rs), consumed by [Leptos](../apps/web/src/api.rs).
The [Schema](schema/studio/v1.schema.json), [raw Rust DTOs](api/src/lib.rs) and
[fixtures](fixtures/studio/v1) are hand-authored. Both consumers test the same fixture source;
backend tests validate live responses with that Schema. No generated OpenAPI/Kotlin API exists.

## Routes

| Method/path under /api/v1 | Request / result |
| --- | --- |
| POST /session | SessionRequest token → SessionResponse actor_id and HttpOnly/SameSite=Strict cookie |
| DELETE /session | Revoke token in PostgreSQL, expire cookie → 204 |
| GET /scripts/{UUID}/head | Current authorized Revision |
| GET /scripts/{UUID}/revisions/{positive revision} | Pinned immutable Revision, current access still required |
| POST /scripts/{UUID}/revisions | SaveRevision → Revision; 200 for both acceptance and exact replay |

All mutations require the configured exact Origin. API responses carry no-store/nosniff.
An existing active, unexpired, unrevoked database session authenticates the actor; request
actor headers are ignored. Tokens are exactly 64 hex characters, stored as SHA-256 hashes.
The cookie lacks Secure only because this host deliberately supports loopback development HTTP.
Production sign-in, HTTPS and Secure cookies require a separate reviewed deployment.

Owners/editors read and write; readers only read. Unknown/inaccessible scripts return 404,
not an existence leak; a known reader's write returns 403. First save at base 0 atomically
creates an owner script with revision 1. Later saves require its locked current head. Each
read, save and retry checks current access. A revoked member/session cannot replay old results
through this API.

SaveRevision contains expected_revision (0..i64::MAX), operation_id (canonical lowercase UUID)
and script_json (complete Script IR JSON string). The server revalidates schema/text/semantics,
canonicalizes a complete export, resolves every source/rights/generation/asset reference to
an immutable registry record owned by the script owner, then appends within one transaction.
Registry existence/ownership does not assert legal publication eligibility or preserved source
bytes. Validated storage acceptance does not mean production approval.

## Retry and integrity

The durable key is (script_id, authenticated actor, operation_id). Reuse with the same expected
base and complete canonical export returns the original revision, actor and UTC microsecond
timestamp even if the head has moved. A changed snapshot or base returns operation_reused.
Prior-operation lookup precedes the stale-head decision, after current authorization. A
different new key with a stale base returns stale_revision/current_revision. There is no
deduplication by c1, e1 or text equality.

An unknown transport/commit outcome must retry the same key/base/export as the original actor.
A caller cannot infer rollback from losing an HTTP response. The Studio keeps that snapshot in
memory, blocks new save/read intents until reconciliation, and preserves separately edited text.
A browser reload loses this in-memory intent; durable client recovery is a future authoring gate.

Revision returns script_id, revision, accepted_by, accepted_at, content_digest, export_digest
and the exact complete canonical script_json. Accepted rows and their evidence links are
append-only. Reads re-admit canonical bytes and verify both digests; corruption returns 500
rather than normalized/repaired content.

```text
ExportDigest = "sir-e1:sha256:" + lowercase_hex(
    SHA256(b"cantos/script-export/e1\n" + complete_canonical_export_bytes)
)
```

e1 includes schema, provenance and rights references omitted by the unchanged c1 content
projection. Revision identity plus its full export/evidence remains the accepted fact.

## Errors and bounds

| HTTP | code | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | invalid_request | Invalid DTO, UUID or revision bounds |
| 401 | unauthenticated | Missing, invalid, inactive, expired or revoked session |
| 403 | forbidden | Reader write or invalid mutation Origin |
| 404 | not_found | No row in current actor scope |
| 409 | stale_revision | Head changed; current_revision supplied |
| 409 | operation_reused | Same actor/key bound to another base/export |
| 422 | invalid_script / evidence_unavailable | Invalid IR or missing owner evidence |
| 503 | unavailable | Pool, statement/lock/request deadline or unknown transport/commit result |
| 500 | corrupt_revision | Stored canonical bytes/digest failed admission |

ApiError has code, nullable current_revision and issues [{path, rule}]. IR diagnostics expose
stable codes/paths, not raw manuscript values or SQL errors. Input IR is bounded to 2 MiB bytes;
the HTTP envelope limit is 8 MiB, allowing JSON escaping overhead. Pool size 8, wait/connect
5s, SQL 5s, lock 3s, idle transaction 10s and HTTP deadline 15s bound this development slice.
These are resource guardrails, not measured latency targets or production sizing.

Version 1 admits Script IR 0.1.0 only. Any changed wire semantics needs a compatibility decision
and shared fixture updates; no persisted older version conversion exists. See
[persistence evidence](../docs/evidence/script-revision-persistence.md).

## Editorial handoff extensions

These additive v1 routes use the same cookie, Origin guard, no-store responses and error shape.
Existing save/read DTOs and Script IR c1/e1 remain unchanged. New raw DTOs, Schema definitions
and fixtures live alongside the original contract.

| Route under /api/v1 | Request / result |
| --- | --- |
| GET /scripts/{UUID}/history | Optional `after_revision` (default 0) and `limit` (default 20, range 1–50) → History |
| POST /scripts/{UUID}/reviews | ReviewRequest `{operation_id, revision}` → Review; owner only |
| GET /scripts/{UUID}/sources/{SOURCE_ID} | Source with exact UTF-8 text/hash, only if linked from the script's immutable history |

History contains ascending `revisions` summaries (script/revision, accepted actor/time, c1/e1),
`reviews` for those same revisions, and nullable `next_after`. Open a manuscript through the
existing pinned revision route; history omits its body. Each page checks current access and
holds the script's share lock while reading and integrity-checking its rows. New revisions
between pages appear after the previous cursor; pages are not a frozen full-history snapshot.
An empty/last page has `next_after: null`. Invalid bounds or unknown query fields return 400.
No cache or incremental read model bypasses authorization.

A new review must name the locked current head, with a canonical UUID operation key. A retry
with the same actor/key/revision returns the first review even if the head advances; changing
its revision returns `operation_reused`. A new key for an already reviewed revision also
returns its first review and records that receipt. An old unreviewed revision returns
`stale_revision`. Review and receipt commit atomically. Editors/readers cannot review; readers
and editors can inspect history/sources while their current script access permits it.
Review has `id`, script/revision, original operation ID, reviewed actor/time and the pinned
revision's c1/e1. Review is editorial evidence, not production or publication approval.

Source has `id`, `reference`, `original_text`, `sha256` and `recorded_at`. Original text is
bounded to 1 MiB UTF-8 bytes, preserved without normalization and hash-checked on read. It is
available only through a currently authorized script and its source evidence links. Missing,
unlinked and inaccessible sources return 404. A registry-only legacy source remains valid
for existing save/read semantics but returns 404 here until explicitly preserved by an operator.
Source text is never embedded into a publication manifest or public route. Rights assertions,
generation and selected asset references still require their existing registry ownership checks
and downstream eligibility gates.
