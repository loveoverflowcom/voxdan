# MVP work queue

Start with [#1](https://github.com/loveoverflowcom/cantos/issues/1) within [010 — Import and edit a versioned script](010-import-and-edit-script.md). Each item delivers a usable business capability; implementation details must be confirmed against the code created in earlier items.

The repository has documentation/templates, an executable
[Script IR contract](../../contracts/README.md), and a local authenticated immutable revision
store with a minimal Studio consumer. The end-to-end capabilities below remain
planned. Numeric filename prefixes express the current recommended sequence, may be renumbered,
and are not permanent task IDs.

| Order | Outcome | Prerequisite |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [010](010-import-and-edit-script.md) | A creator imports a manuscript, reviews an adaptation, and saves an editable Script IR version. | Project brief and architecture decisions |
| [020](020-cast-and-generate-dialogue.md) | A creator assigns voices and generates dialogue through durable, resumable jobs. | Validated scripts from 010 |
| [030](030-mix-review-and-publish.md) | A creator mixes, reviews, uploads, and publishes a complete episode. | Generated dialogue from 020 |
| [040](040-theatre-web-listening.md) | A listener discovers and streams published episodes in Theatre Web. | Published manifests and media from 030 |
| [050](050-cmp-native-listening.md) | A listener uses native Android/iOS playback, downloads, and synchronized progress. | Publication contracts from 030 and listening contracts from 040 |

## GitHub execution

[Kanban](https://github.com/users/loveoverflowcom/projects/6/views/1) · [Planning table](https://github.com/users/loveoverflowcom/projects/6/views/2) · [Detailed issue/dependency map](project-planning.md)

The five capability specifications map to 17 bounded implementation issues. Use the Project for
current execution Status and issue checklists/dependencies for evidence; this queue retains
recommended sequence and scope. Review the
[persistence evidence](../evidence/script-revision-persistence.md),
[affected read inventory](../evidence/script-revision-reads.md) and
[bounded read benchmark](../evidence/script-revision-performance.md) before continuing
[#1](https://github.com/loveoverflowcom/cantos/issues/1). Prompt 3 measures the implemented
point reads and a disposable covering-index comparison; it adds no engine or production
schema/query change. DBSP remains deferred: there is no measured hot repeated aggregate or
large join consumer to maintain. The completed
[conditional prompt-4 decision](../evidence/script-revision-dbsp-decision.md) records DEFER,
the missing admission evidence and measurable reopening criteria. Reopen an engine experiment
only for a concrete hot consumer after its simpler PostgreSQL comparison, with a reviewed
adapter, committed-position/freshness contract and resource/recovery budgets. This is not the
next automatic implementation.
Continue the bounded importer/editor work in 010 while preserving complete exports, actor
filters, immutable revision identity and retry semantics. Revisit read optimization when that
work changes cardinality, evidence fan-out or introduces an actual list/join/aggregate. The
minimal JSON editor and development sessions do not satisfy the full #1/010 capability or
authorize closing its issue. GitHub execution status is unchanged by this local evidence.

The independent [final sequence review](../evidence/script-revision-final-review.md) fixes
exact numeric admission, normalization/export bounds, pronunciation validation memory,
disposable-runner isolation and cleanup, and Studio save-target status. Its final local checks
include real PostgreSQL recovery and a bounded Safari walkthrough. Continue 010 with these
guards; the review does not complete its importer/editor acceptance or reopen DBSP integration.

The compatible [editorial handoff](../evidence/editorial-handoff.md) retains that backend and
Studio while adding preserved source text, owner review records, bounded history and local
operator provisioning. Continue 010's importer/source-preview/editor consumer on these existing
boundaries; expose the handoff operations through a reviewed UI when that journey needs them.
Production identity, rights eligibility and full authoring acceptance remain separate gates.

The [bounded manuscript import](../evidence/manuscript-import.md) extends that same source
boundary with preserved original bytes, extraction outcomes and a minimal Studio comparison.
The [AI adaptation #3](https://github.com/loveoverflowcom/cantos/issues/3) consumer preserves
immutable source IDs/checksums, ordered blocks, uncertainty and recorded rights claims.
Prioritize the full editor in #4 next. Keep #1's production identity and complete authoring
gates visible; import/adaptation evidence does not accept the entire 010 capability.

The [bounded adaptation implementation](../evidence/ai-script-adaptation.md) uses that source
and revision authority for immutable context, caller-submitted proposals, declared provenance,
receipts and explicit acceptance. The user-controlled Gemini/ChatGPT/Codex host owns generation;
Cantos owns the authenticated tool pipeline and validation. #3 acceptance requires real tool
transport and PostgreSQL journey evidence; actual model output quality is separately NOT_RUN.
The former local-model gate is superseded, not passed. Its evidence now records the actual
tool/storage journey. #4 should consume the same proposal/revision authority for full
scene/speaker authoring, preserving provenance and concurrency rather than adding another
draft store. GitHub issues/PRs retain delivery and execution status.

## How to use this queue

- Read the project brief and architecture documents before starting an item; the brief is authoritative.
- Use the linked implementation issues when execution begins; create additional issues only for newly bounded work. Linked GitHub issues are the source of truth for assignment, current status, discussion, and acceptance; these files preserve scope, reasoning, and sequence. Do not maintain a competing status board here.
- Deliver one reviewable outcome at a time. Internal steps may span several PRs, but each PR must identify its review boundary and avoid implying that the whole item is complete.
- Confirm domain and platform assumptions against the actual code, migrations, provider behavior, and runtime before choosing concrete modules, tables, or routes.
- After a completed item, update this queue to make the next task obvious. Record necessary correctness work as a dependency; put optional expansion in [the backlog](backlog/deferred-expansion.md).

## Shared completion evidence

Database-backed read work in every slice uses the foundation's
[PostgreSQL/DBSP evaluation workflow](../../.agents/skills/cantos-engineering/references/postgresql-read-performance.md).
Prioritize measured GET/read/fetch bottlenecks as their implementation appears; keep the order
above. [Skill-update evidence](../evidence/postgresql-dbsp-skills.md) records instruction checks,
not an engine integration or benchmark. A candidate with measured need must earn a scoped
proposal/ADR within its owning slice; this update schedules no engine deployment or migration.

The [story artifact workspace](../production/story-workspace.md) supplies agent-operated intake,
proper-name mapping, radio-score authoring, production handoffs and audit through Drive/local
folders. Its skills and local initializer support editorial preparation for 010–030; they do
not complete the planned importer, provider workers, Studio UI or publication gates. Continue
with the existing recommended implementation order above. Artifact sync failures are tracked
by deduplicated recovery issues (or local drafts while GitHub is unavailable).

For every item, provide the user journey demonstrated, relevant contract/migration changes, targeted failure-case checks, and known limitations. A successful mock response alone does not demonstrate a real provider, storage, or native playback integration. Label mocked and live evidence separately.

Keep Rust/Axum and PostgreSQL as a modular backend with Leptos Web and CMP native mobile clients. Avoid introducing independent services without a demonstrated operational need. Apply the shared Material 3 Expressive design requirements to each UI slice.
