# GitHub planning and execution

[Cantos Project](https://github.com/users/loveoverflowcom/projects/6) · [Kanban](https://github.com/users/loveoverflowcom/projects/6/views/1) · [Planning table](https://github.com/users/loveoverflowcom/projects/6/views/2) · [Repository issues](https://github.com/loveoverflowcom/cantos/issues) · [Milestones](https://github.com/loveoverflowcom/cantos/milestones)

The repository currently contains specifications and templates. These issues plan implementation; creating the board does not establish application, audio or mobile runtime behavior. The Project is private and requires the owner or an authorized collaborator to sign in. Repository documents and issues remain available under their own repository access policy.

## Find the documents

- [Documentation map](../README.md): product, business rules, pipeline, architecture, Script IR, mobile and design.
- [MVP work queue](README.md): capability scope, prerequisites and phase review boundaries.
- [Reusable templates](../../templates/README.md): feature briefs, ADRs, production runs and publication checklists.
- The `Spec` field on each Project item links to its owning Markdown specification. Each issue links additional relevant documents.

Keep specifications in Git, linked to executable issues rather than copied into draft Project cards. Update the owning document when a decision or implemented behavior changes.

## Use the two views

| View | Purpose | Saved organization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Kanban](https://github.com/users/loveoverflowcom/projects/6/views/1) | Track execution and the next ready task | Columns by Status; Order ascending |
| [Planning](https://github.com/users/loveoverflowcom/projects/6/views/2) | Review scope, phase, dependencies and source documents | Group by Phase; Order ascending |

`Order` is the recommended reading/scheduling sequence, not a permanent identifier or a substitute for dependency acceptance. Issue numbers identify execution tasks; numeric specification prefixes can still be reorganized. Filter by Phase or Milestone to focus on one capability.

## Status policy

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Backlog | Planned work whose prerequisites or readiness decisions are pending |
| Ready | Immediate dependencies are accepted and the bounded task can start |
| In progress | Implementation has actually started |
| In review | Focused PR and relevant verification evidence are available |
| Done | Acceptance criteria and applicable capability review gate passed |

At planning setup, only [#1](https://github.com/loveoverflowcom/cantos/issues/1) is Ready; later work waits in Backlog. The live Project owns current Status, issues own acceptance checklists/evidence and native `blocked by` links, and Markdown owns intended scope, rationale and recommended order. This document is not a second live status board.

If an active task becomes blocked, record the reason and native blocking relationship on the issue. Move it back to Backlog when it cannot proceed, preserving its progress and explaining the next action. Move a dependent task to Ready only after its prerequisites are accepted. No deadline, estimate or assignee is implied by this ordering.

## Sequence and parallel work

Start with [#1](https://github.com/loveoverflowcom/cantos/issues/1), then complete the import/adaptation/editor journey before casting. Casting and real provider integration establish the inputs needed by durable generation.

After [#7](https://github.com/loveoverflowcom/cantos/issues/7), the Studio production controls ([#8](https://github.com/loveoverflowcom/cantos/issues/8)), mixing/QC ([#9](https://github.com/loveoverflowcom/cantos/issues/9)) and private storage/delivery ([#10](https://github.com/loveoverflowcom/cantos/issues/10)) can proceed in parallel against concrete clip/artifact contracts. Publication ([#11](https://github.com/loveoverflowcom/cantos/issues/11)) waits for all three acceptance results.

Listener contracts ([#12](https://github.com/loveoverflowcom/cantos/issues/12)) require a complete publication/delivery gate. Theatre Web ([#13](https://github.com/loveoverflowcom/cantos/issues/13)) and native CMP streaming ([#14](https://github.com/loveoverflowcom/cantos/issues/14)) can then proceed in parallel. Native background controls ([#15](https://github.com/loveoverflowcom/cantos/issues/15)) and downloads ([#16](https://github.com/loveoverflowcom/cantos/issues/16)) can run in parallel after native foreground playback. The final cross-device journey ([#17](https://github.com/loveoverflowcom/cantos/issues/17)) waits for Web, background and download acceptance. Contract-fixture experiments before those gates must be labeled as prototypes.

## Phase exit and review evidence

A milestone is complete only when its issues pass acceptance and the owning phase's end-to-end review boundary is demonstrated. Completing a backend task alone does not finish its creator/listener capability.

- **010:** import → adaptation review → edit → save → restart/reopen, with preserved provenance, rights and immutable versions.
- **020:** casting → real local/commercial TTS → clip preview → partial regeneration, including crash recovery, bounded retries and budget/ambiguous-charge handling.
- **030:** real multi-voice mixing → measured and editorial QC → verified upload → exact-revision approval → atomic publication/replacement, preserving a playable prior release on failure.
- **040:** real discovery/CDN playback → bookmark → reload/resume → two-session synchronization, including deliberate rewind and release-version changes.
- **050:** Android and iOS native play → background/lock-screen → verified offline play → restart/resume → Web/mobile sync, with platform lifecycle and accessibility observations.

Branch from `develop`, keep PRs focused and target `develop`. Attach demonstrated journeys, relevant contract/migration changes, targeted failure checks and known limitations. Distinguish live evidence from mocks. A document check cannot establish a successful app build, real audio quality or native runtime behavior.

Keep [deferred expansion](backlog/deferred-expansion.md) outside the MVP board until evidence or an explicit product decision justifies promotion. Add a new issue with its own acceptance and dependency review instead of silently expanding an active task.
